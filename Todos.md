## Code:

- Clean up the code.

## Fix:

- Unchecked runtime.lastError: No tab with id: <<tab id>>.

## Visual:

- Add animations everywhere you can.
- Add a loading indicator for content like the first animation.
- Remove the slider until all the content loaded.
- If it is possible reduce the font size if the name overflowed.

## Maybes:

- Make extension work for the lists as well. Well, this is a lot of work because of pagination.
- Add another tabs in popup for settings, stars, socials etc.
